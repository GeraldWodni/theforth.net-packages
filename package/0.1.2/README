ABOUT

  This package implements the following words from SwiftForth:

    PACKAGE
    PUBLIC
    PRIVATE
    END-PACKAGE
    \\  (in compat libs)

  Examples and further discussion of these words is included in package.fs

COMPATABILITY

  SwiftForth already implements these words

  VFX Forth can load package.fs as is

  GForth 0.7.9+ can load packages.fs after loading compat-gforth.fs
  (NB. this version is due to N>R , not just {: :} )

  iforth should load package-iforth.fs instead, which uses a separate wordlist
  for PUBLIC PRIVATE END-PACKAGE in order to preserve the usual iforth meaning
  of PRIVATE

  ciforth:

    1 LOAD
    WANT INCLUDE CASE-INSENSITIVE WORD :NONAME -ROT LOCAL VOCABULARY [UNDEFINED]
    ( for tests.fs: ) WANT DEFER ORDER
    CASE-INSENSITIVE
    include compat-ciforth.fs
    include package.fs

CHANGELOG

0.1.2 - fixed compat-ciforth.fs: GET-ORDER's return was reversed
