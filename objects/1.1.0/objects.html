<title>Yet another Forth objects package</title>

<h1>Yet another Forth objects package</h1>

After criticizing the Neon model in <a href="opinion.html">the last
issue</a>, here I present (and expose to criticism) a model that I
find better, and its implementation. Its properties (most are
advantages IMO) are:

<ul>

<li>It is straightforward to pass objects on the stack. Passing
selectors on the stack is a little less convenient, but possible.

<li>Objects are just data structures in memory, and are referenced by
their address. You can create words for objects with normal defining
words like <code>constant</code>. Likewise, there is no difference
between instance variables that contain objects and those
that contain other data.

<li>Late binding is efficient and easy to use.

<li>It avoids parsing, and thus avoids problems with state-smartness
and reduced extensibility; for convenience there are a few parsing
words, but they have non-parsing counterparts. There are also a few
defining words that parse. This is hard to avoid, because all standard
defining words parse (except <code>:noname</code>); however, such
words are not as bad as many other parsing words, because they are not
state-smart.

<li>It does not try to incorporate everything. It does a few things
and does them well (IMO). In particular, I did not intend to support
information hiding with this model (although it has features that may
help); you can use a separate package for achieving this.

<li>It is layered; you don't have to learn and use all features to use
this model. In particular, the features discussed after the Section
<em>Programming Style</em> are are optional and independent of each
other.

<li>An implementation in ANS Forth is available.

</ul>

I have used the technique, on which this model is based, for
implementing Gray <a href="#ertl89">[ertl89]</a><a
href="#ertl97">[ertl97]</a>; we have also used this technique in
Gforth.

<p>This paper assumes (in some places) that you have read the <a
href="structs.html">paper on structures</a>.

<h2>Why object-oriented programming?</h2>

Often we have to deal with several data structures (<em>objects</em>),
that have to be treated similarly in some respects, but differ in
others. Graphical objects are the textbook example: circles,
triangles, dinosaurs, icons, and others, and we may want to add more
during program development. We want to apply some operations to any
graphical object, e.g., <code>draw</code> for displaying it on the
screen. However, <code>draw</code> has to do something different for
every kind of object.

<p>We could implement <code>draw</code> as a big <code>CASE</code>
control structure that executes the appropriate code depending on the
kind of object to be drawn. This would be not be very elegant, and,
moreover, we would have to change <code>draw</code> every time we add
a new kind of graphical object (say, a spaceship).

<p>What we would rather do is: When defining spaceships, we would tell
the system: "Here's how you <code>draw</code> a spaceship; you figure
out the rest."

<p>This is the problem that all systems solve that (rightfully) call
themselves object-oriented, and the object-oriented package I present
here also solves this problem (and not much else).

<h2>Terminology</h2>

This section is mainly for reference, so you don't have to understand
all of it right away. I (mostly) use the same Smalltalk-inspired
terminology as <a href="#mckewan97">[mckewan97]</a>.  In short:

<dl>

<dt>class <dd>a data structure definition with some extras.

<dt>object
<dd>an instance of the data structure described by the class definition.

<dt>instance variables
<dd>fields of the data structure.

<dt>selector <dd>(or <em>method selector</em>) a word (e.g.,
<code>draw</code>) for performing an operation on a variety of data
structures (classes). A selector describes <em>what</em> operation to
perform. In C++ terminology: a (pure) virtual function.

<dt>method <dd>the concrete definition that performs the operation
described by the selector for a specific class. A method specifies
<em>how</em> the operation is performed for a specific class.

<dt>selector invocation <dd>a call of a selector. One argument of the
call (the TOS (top-of-stack)) is used for determining which method is used. In Smalltalk
terminology: a message (consisting of the selector and the other
arguments) is sent to the object.

<dt>receiving object <dd>the object used for determining the method
executed by a selector invocation. In our model it is the object that
is on the TOS when the selector is invoked. (<em>Receiving</em> comes
from Smalltalks <em>message</em> terminology.)

<dt>child class <dd>a class that has (<em>inherits</em>) all
properties (instance variables, selectors, methods) from a <em>parent
class</em>. In Smalltalk terminology: The subclass inherits from the
superclass. In C++ terminology: The derived class inherits from the
base class.

</dl>

<!--If you wonder about the message sending terminology, it comes from
a time when each object had it's own task and objects communicated via
message passing; eventually the Smalltalk developers realized that
they can do most things through simple (indirect) calls. They kept the
terminology.-->

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

You can define a class for graphical objects like this:

<pre>
object class \ "object" is the parent class
  selector draw ( x y graphical -- )
end-class graphical
</pre>

This code defines a class <code>graphical</code> with an
operation <code>draw</code>.  We can perform the operation
<code>draw</code> on any <code>graphical</code> object, e.g.:

<pre>
100 100 t-rex draw
</pre>

where <code>t-rex</code> is a word (say, a constant) that produces a
graphical object.

<p>How do we create a graphical object? With the present definitions,
we cannot create a useful graphical object. The class
<code>graphical</code> describes graphical objects in general, but not
any concrete graphical object type (C++ users would call it an
<em>abstract class</em>); e.g., there is no method for the selector
<code>draw</code> in the class <code>graphical</code>.

<p>For concrete graphical objects, we define child classes of the
class <code>graphical</code>, e.g.:

<pre>
graphical class \ "graphical" is the parent class
  cell% field circle-radius

:noname ( x y circle -- )
  circle-radius @ draw-circle ;
overrides draw

:noname ( n-radius circle -- )
  circle-radius ! ;
overrides construct

end-class circle
</pre>

Here we define a class <code>circle</code> as a child of
<code>graphical</code>, with a field <code>circle-radius</code> (which
behaves just like a field in <a href="structs.html">the structure
package</a>); it defines new methods for the selectors
<code>draw</code> and <code>construct</code> (<code>construct</code>
is defined in <code>object</code>, the parent class of
<code>graphical</code>).

<p>Now we can create a circle on the heap (i.e.,
<code>allocate</code>d memory) with

<pre>
50 circle heap-new constant my-circle
</pre>

<code>heap-new</code> invokes <code>construct</code>, thus
initializing the field <code>circle-radius</code> with 50. We can draw
this new circle at (100,100) with

<pre>
100 100 my-circle draw
</pre>

Note: You can invoke a selector only if the object on the TOS
(the receiving object) belongs to the class where the selector was
defined or one of its descendents; e.g., you can invoke
<code>draw</code> only for objects belonging to <code>graphical</code>
or its descendents (e.g., <code>circle</code>).  Immediately before
<code>end-class</code>, the search order has to be the same as
immediately after <code>class</code>.

<h2>The <code>object</code> class</h2>

When you define a class, you have to specify a parent class.  So how
do you start defining classes? There is one class available from the
start: <code>object</code>. You can use it as ancestor for all
classes. It is the only class that has no parent. It has two
selectors: <code>construct</code> and <code>print</code>.

<h2>Creating objects</h2>

You can create and initialize an object of a class on the heap with
<code>heap-new</code> ( ... class -- object ) and in the dictionary
(allocation with <code>allot</code>) with <code>dict-new</code> (
... class -- object ). Both words invoke <code>construct</code>, which
consumes the stack items indicated by "..." above.

<p>If you want to allocate memory for an object yourself, you can get its
alignment and size with <code>class-inst-size 2@</code> ( class --
align size ). Once you have memory for an object, you can initialize
it with <code>init-object</code> ( ... class object -- );
<code>construct</code> does only a part of the necessary work.

<h2>Programming style</h2>

This section is not exhaustive.

<p>In general, it is a good idea to ensure that all methods for the
same selector have the same stack effect: when you invoke a selector,
you often have no idea which method will be invoked, so, unless all
methods have the same stack effect, you will not know the stack effect
of the selector invocation.

<p>One exception to this rule is methods for the selector
<code>construct</code>. We know which method is invoked, because we
specify the class to be constructed at the same place. Actually, I
defined <code>construct</code> as a selector only to give the users a
convenient way to specify initialization. The way it is used, a
mechanism different from selector invocation would be more natural
(but probably would take more code and more space to explain).

<h2>Class Binding</h2>

Normal selector invocations determine the method at run-time depending
on the class of the receiving object (late binding).

<p>Sometimes we want to invoke a different method. E.g., assume that
you want to use the simple method for <code>print</code>ing
<code>object</code>s instead of the possibly long-winded
<code>print</code> method of the receiver class. You can achieve this
by replacing the invocation of <code>print</code> with

<pre>
[bind] object print
</pre>

in compiled code or

<pre>
bind object print
</pre>

in interpreted code. Alternatively, you can define the method with a
name (e.g., <code>print-object</code>), and then invoke it through the
name. Class binding is just a (often more convenient) way to achieve
the same effect; it avoids name clutter and allows you to invoke
methods directly without naming them first.

<p>A frequent use of class binding is this: When we define a method
for a selector, we often want the method to do what the selector does
in the parent class, and a little more. There is a special word for
this purpose: <code>[parent]</code>; <code>[parent]
<em>selector</em></code> is equivalent to <code>[bind] <em>parent
selector</em></code>, where <code><em>parent</em></code> is the parent
class of the current class. E.g., a method definition might look like:

<pre>
:noname
  dup [parent] foo \ do parent's foo on the receiving object
  ... \ do some more
; overrides foo
</pre>

<p><a href="#mckewan97">[mckewan97]</a> presents class binding as an optimization technique. I
recommend not using it for this purpose unless you are in an
emergency. Late binding is pretty fast with this model anyway, so the
benefit of using class binding is small; the cost of using class
binding where it is not appropriate is reduced maintainability.

<p>While we are at programming style questions: You should bind
selectors only to ancestor classes of the receiving object. E.g., say,
you know that the receiving object is of class <code>foo</code> or its
descendents; then you should bind only to <code>foo</code> and its
ancestors.

<h2>Method conveniences</h2>

In a method you usually access the receiving object pretty often.  If
you define the method as a plain colon definition (e.g., with
<code>:noname</code>), you may have to do a lot of stack
gymnastics. To avoid this, you can define the method with <code>m:
... ;m</code>. E.g., you could define the method for
<code>draw</code>ing a <code>circle</code> with

<pre>
m: ( x y circle -- )
  ( x y ) this circle-radius @ draw-circle ;m
</pre>

When this method is executed, the receiver object is removed from the
stack; you can access it with <code>this</code> (admittedly, in this
example the use of <code>m: ... ;m</code> offers no advantage). Note
that I specify the stack effect for the whole method (i.e. including
the receiver object), not just for the code between <code>m:</code>
and <code>;m</code>. You cannot use <code>exit</code> in
<code>m:...;m</code>; instead, use
<code>exitm</code>. <!--footnote-->Moreover, for any word that calls
<code>catch</code> and was defined before loading
<code>objects.fs</code>, you have to redefine it like I redefined
<code>catch</code>:

<pre>
: catch this >r catch r> to-this ;
</pre>
<!-- end footnote -->

<p>You will frequently use sequences of the form <code>this
<em>field</em></code> (in the example above: <code>this
circle-radius</code>). If you use the field only in this way, you can
define it with <code>inst-var</code> and eliminate the
<code>this</code> before the field name. E.g., the <code>circle</code>
class above could also be defined with:

<pre>
graphical class
  cell% inst-var radius

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius @ draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  radius ! ;m
overrides construct

end-class circle
</pre>

<code>radius</code> can only be used in <code>circle</code> and its
descendent classes and inside <code>m:...;m</code>.

<p>You can also define fields with <code>inst-value</code>, which is
to <code>inst-var</code> what <code>value</code> is to
<code>variable</code>.  You can change the value of such a field with
<code>[to-inst]</code>.  E.g., we could also define the class
<code>circle</code> like this:

<pre>
graphical class
  inst-value radius

m: ( x y circle -- )
  radius draw-circle ;m
overrides draw

m: ( n-radius circle -- )
  [to-inst] radius ;m
overrides construct

end-class circle
</pre>


<h2>Names and Scoping</h2>

Inheritance is frequent, unlike structure extension. This exacerbates
the problem with the field name convention: One always has to remember
in which class the field was originally defined; changing a part of
the class structure would require changes for renaming in otherwise
unaffected code.

<p>To solve this problem, I added a scoping mechanism (which was not
in my original charter): A field defined with <code>inst-var</code> is
visible only in the class where it is defined and in the descendent
classes of this class.  Using such fields only makes sense in
<code>m:</code>-defined methods in these classes anyway.

<p>This scoping mechanism allows us to use the unadorned field name,
because name clashes with unrelated words become much less likely.

<p>Once we have this mechanism, we can also use it for controlling the
visibility of other words: All words defined after
<code>protected</code> are visible only in the current class and its
descendents. <code>public</code> restores the compilation
(i.e. <code>current</code>) wordlist that was in effect before. If you
have several <code>protected</code>s without an intervening
<code>public</code> or <code>set-current</code>, <code>public</code>
will restore the compilation wordlist in effect before the first of
these <code>protected</code>s.

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

In this model you can only call selectors defined in the class of the
receiving objects or in one of its ancestors. If you call a selector
with a receiving object that is not in one of these classes, the
result is undefined; if you are lucky, the program crashes
immediately.

<p>Now consider the case when you want to have a selector (or several)
available in two classes: You would have to add the selector to a
common ancestor class, in the worst case to <code>object</code>. You
may not want to do this, e.g., because someone else is responsible for
this ancestor class.

<p>The solution for this problem is interfaces. An interface is a
collection of selectors. If a class implements an interface, the
selectors become available to the class and its descendents. A class
can implement an unlimited number of interfaces. For the problem
discussed above, we would define an interface for the selector(s), and
both classes would implement the interface.

<p>As an example, consider an interface <code>storage</code> for
writing objects to disk and getting them back, and a class
<code>foo</code> foo that implements it. The code for this would look
like this:

<pre>
interface
  selector write ( file object -- )
  selector read1 ( file object -- )
end-interface storage

bar class
  storage implementation

... overrides write
... overrides read
...
end-class foo
</pre>

(I would add a word <code>read</code> ( file -- object ) that uses
<code>read1</code> internally, but that's beyond the point illustrated
here.)

<p>Note that you cannot use <code>protected</code> in an interface; and
of course you cannot define fields.

<p>In the Neon model, all selectors are available for all classes;
therefore it does not need interfaces. The price you pay in this model
is slower late binding, and therefore, added complexity to avoid late
binding.

<h2>Persistence</h2>

The internal data of classes and interfaces are stored in the
dictionary, so they survive the usual system-saving and reloading
mechanisms of Forth systems.  For objects, it's up to you to save them
in the dictionary if you want them to survive.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

An object is a piece of memory, like one of the data structures
described with <code>struct...end-struct</code>. It has a field
<code>object-map</code> that points to the method map for the object's
class.

<p>The <em>method map</em> (<!--footnote-->this is Self
<a href="#chambers&ungar89">[chambers&ungar89]</a> terminology; in C++ terminology: virtual function
table) is an array that contains the execution tokens (XTs) of the
methods for the object's class. Each selector contains an offset into
the method maps.

<p><code>selector</code> is a defining word that uses
<code>create</code> and <code>does&gt;</code>. The body of the
selector contains the offset; the <code>does&gt;</code> action for a
class selector is, basically:

<pre>
( object addr ) @ over object-map @ + @ execute
</pre>

Since <code>object-map</code> is the first field of the object, it
does not generate any code. As you can see, calling a selector has a
small, constant cost.

<p>A class is basically a <code>struct</code> combined with a method
map. During the class definition the alignment and size of the class
are passed on the stack, just as with <code>struct</code>s, so
<code>field</code> can also be used for defining class
fields. However, passing more items on the stack would be
inconvenient, so <code>class</code> builds a data structure in memory,
which is accessed through the variable
<code>current-interface</code>. After its definition is complete, the
class is represented on the stack by a pointer (e.g., as parameter for
a child class definition).

<p>At the start, a new class has the alignment and size of its parent,
and a copy of the parent's method map. Defining new fields extends the
size and alignment; likewise, defining new selectors extends the
method map. <code>overrides</code> just stores a new XT in the method
map at the offset given by the selector.

<p>Class binding just gets the XT at the offset given by the selector
from the class's method map and <code>compile,</code>s (in the case of
<code>[bind]</code>) it.

<p>I implemented <code>this</code> as a <code>value</code>. At the
start of an <code>m:...;m</code> method the old <code>this</code> is
stored to the return stack and restored at the end; and the object on
the TOS is stored <code>TO this</code>. This technique has one
disadvantage: If the user does not leave the method via
<code>;m</code>, but via <code>throw</code> or <code>exit</code>,
<code>this</code> is not restored (and <code>exit</code> may
crash). To deal with the <code>throw</code> problem, I have redefined
<code>catch</code> to save and restore <code>this</code>; the same
should be done with any word that can catch an exception. As for
<code>exit</code>, I simply forbid it (as a replacement, there is
<code>exitm</code>).

<p><code>inst-var</code> is just the same as <code>field</code>, with
a different <code>does&gt;</code> action:
<pre>
@ this +
</pre>
Similar for <code>inst-value</code>.

<p>Each class also has a wordlist that contains the words defined with
<code>inst-var</code> and <code>inst-value</code>, and its protected
words. It also has a pointer to its parent. <code>class</code> pushes
the wordlists of the class an all its ancestors on the search order,
and <code>end-class</code> drops them.

<p>An interface is like a class without fields, parent and protected
words; i.e., it just has a method map. If a class implements an
interface, its method map contains a pointer to the method map of the
interface. The positive offsets in the map are reserved for class
methods, therefore interface map pointers have negative
offsets. Interfaces have offsets that are unique throughout the
system, unlike class selectors, whose offsets are only unique for the
classes where the selector is available (invokable).

<p>This structure means that interface selectors have to perform one
indirection more than class selectors to find their method. Their body
contains the interface map pointer offset in the class method map, and
the method offset in the interface method map. The
<code>does&gt;</code> action for an interface selector is, basically:

<pre>
( object selector-body )
2dup selector-interface @ ( object selector-body object interface-offset )
swap object-map @ + @ ( object selector-body map )
swap selector-offset @ + @ execute
</pre>

where <code>object-map</code> and <code>selector-offset</code> are
first fields and generate no code.

<p>As a concrete example, consider the following code:

<pre>
interface
  selector if1sel1
  selector if1sel2
end-interface if1

object class
  if1 implementation
  selector cl1sel1
  cell% inst-var cl1iv1

' m1 overrides construct
' m2 overrides if1sel1
' m3 overrides if1sel2
' m4 overrides cl1sel2
end-class cl1

create obj1 object dict-new drop
create obj2 cl1    dict-new drop
</pre>

The data structure created by this code (including the data structure
for <code>object</code>) is shown in the <a
href="objects-implementation.eps">figure</a>, assuming a cell size of
4.

<h2>Related Work</h2>

For a comparison with the Neon model you just have to compare the
properties of the Neon model presented in <a href="opinion.html">the
last issue</a> with the properties presented here.

<p>Another well-known publication is <a href="#pountain87">[pountain87]</a>. However, it is not
really about object-oriented programming, because it hardly deals with
late binding. Instead, it focuses on features like information hiding
and overloading that are characteristic of modular languages like Ada
(83).

<p>There are also many other papers on object-oriented Forth
extensions; E.g., <a href="#rodriguez&poehlman96">[rodriguez&poehlman96]</a> lists 17 and <a href="#mckewan97">[mckewan97]</a> lists
6. In the rest of this section I will discuss two systems that have
the implementation using method maps in common with the package
discussed here.

<p>The model of <a href="#zsoter96">[zsoter96]</a> makes heavy use of an active object (like
<code>this</code> in my model): The active object is not only used for
accessing all fields, but also specifies the receiving object of every
selector invocation; you have to change the active object explicitly
with <code>{ ... }</code>, whereas in my model it changes more or less
implicitly at <code>m: ... ;m</code>. Such a change at the method
entry point is unnecessary with the <a href="#zsoter96">[zsoter96]</a> model, because the
receiving object is the active object already; OTOH, the explicit
change is absolutely necessary in that model, because otherwise no one
could ever change the active object.

<p>The model of <a href="#paysan94">[paysan94]</a> combines
information hiding and overloading resolution (by keeping names in
various wordlists) with object-oriented programming. It sets the
active object implicitly on method entry, but also allows explicit
changing (with <code>&gt;o...o&gt;</code> or with
<code>with...endwith</code>). It uses parsing and state-smart objects
and classes for resolving overloading and for early binding: the
object or class parses the selector and determines the method from
this. If the selector is not parsed by an object or class, it performs
a call to the selector for the active object (late binding), like <a
href="#zsoter96">[zsoter96]</a>.  Fields are always accessed through
the active object. The big disadvantage of this model is the parsing
and the state-smartness, which reduces extensibility and increases the
opportunities for subtle bugs; essentially, you are only safe if you
never tick or <code>postpone</code> an object or class.

<dt><code>public ( -- )</code> <dd>restore the compilation wordlist
that was in effect before the last <code>protected</code> that
actually changed the compilation wordlist.

<dt><code>push-order ( class -- )</code>
<dd>add <code>class</code>'s wordlists to the search-order (in front)

<dt><code>selector ( "name" -- )</code>
<dd><code>name</code> execution: <code>... object -- ...</code>

<p>creates selector <code>name</code> for the current class and its
descendents; you can set a method for the selector in the current
class with <code>overrides</code>.

<dt><code>this ( -- object )</code> <dd>the receiving object of the
current method (aka active object).

<dt><code>&lt;to-inst&gt; ( w xt -- )</code> <dd>store <code>w</code>
into the field <code>xt</code> in <code>this</code>
object.

<dt><code>[to-inst] ( compile-time: "name" -- ; run-time: w --
)</code> <dd>store <code>w</code> into field <code>name</code> in
<code>this</code> object.

<dt><code>to-this ( object -- )</code> <dd>sets <code>this</code>
(used internally, but useful when debugging).

<dt><code>xt-new ( ... class xt -- object )</code>
<dd>makes a new object, using <code>xt ( align size -- addr )</code>
to get memory.
