This directory contains my structure and objects packages for Forth
and articles about them.

The files are:

struct.fs	the structures package
objects.fs	the objects package
objexamp.fs	test code for the objects package
fifo-example.fs	a more elaborate example using the package
structs.html	Documentation on the structure package
objects.html	Documentation on the objects package
opinion.html	my opinion on the Neon model and about standardizing OO Forth

You can get this whole directory from
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/objects.zip.

You can test the package by loading struct.fs, then objects,fs, then
objexamp.fs. The output should look similar to this:
