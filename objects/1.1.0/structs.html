<title>Yet another Forth structures package</title>

<h1>Yet another Forth structures package</h1>

Many ways to add a feature like C's <code>struct</code> or Pascal's
<code>RECORD</code> have been presented and discussed in the Forth
community. One of them was posted on the
USENET newsgroup <a href="news:comp.lang.forth">comp.lang.forth</a> in
1989 (unfortunately I don't remember, by whom; possibly John Hayes)
and convinced me with its simplicity, elegance, and power (in a word,
with its Forth-ness).

<p>I have used this basic approach ever since, e.g, in the parser
generator Gray <a href="#ertl89">[ertl89]</a><a href="#ertl97">[ertl97]</a>.  It also inspired my approach for an
object-oriented Forth extension.  The package I present here adds
automatic handling of alignments, a bit of syntactic sugar, and
optimization of fields with offset 0.

<h2>Why explicit structure support?</h2>

If we want to use a structure containing several fields, we could
simply reserve memory for it, and access the fields using address
arithmetic. As an example, consider a structure with the following
fields

<dl>
<dt>a<dd>is a float
<dt>b<dd>is a cell
<dt>c<dd>is a float
</dl>

Given the (float-aligned) base address of the structure we get the
address of the field

<dl>
<dt>a<dd>without doing anything further.
<dt>b<dd>with <code>float+</code>
<dt>c<dd>with <code>float+ cell+ faligned</code>
</dl>

It is easy to see that this can become quite tiring. 

<p>Moreover, it is not very readable, because seeing a
<code>cell+</code> tells us neither which kind of structure is
accessed nor what field is accessed; we have to somehow infer the kind
of structure, and then look up in the documentation, which field of
that structure corresponds to that offset.

<p>Finally, this kind of address arithmetic also causes maintenance
troubles: If you add or delete a field somewhere in the middle of the
structure, you have to find and change all computations for the fields
afterwards.<!--(You may ask why you would want to add a field in the
middle; one reason is if you have a base structure and have derived
extended structures (see !!) from them, and now want to add a field to
the base structure; this field would appear in the middle of the
extended structures).-->

<p>So, instead of using <code>cell+</code> and friends directly, how
about storing the offsets in constants:

<pre>
0 constant a-offset
0 float+ constant b-offset
0 float+ cell+ faligned constant c-offset
</pre>

Now we can get the address of field <code>x</code> with <code>x-offset
+</code>. This is much better in all respects. Of course, you still
have to change all later offset definitions if you add a field. You can
fix this by declaring the offsets in the following way:

<pre>
0 constant a-offset
a-offset float+ constant b-offset
b-offset cell+ faligned constant c-offset
</pre>

Since we always use the offsets with <code>+</code>, using a defining
word <code>cfield</code> that includes the <code>+</code> in the
action of the defined word offers itself:

<pre>
: cfield ( n "name" -- )
    create ,
does> ( name execution: addr1 -- addr2 )
    @ + ;

0 cfield a
0 a float+ cfield b
0 b cell+ faligned cfield c
</pre>

Instead of <code>x-offset +</code>, we now simply write <code>x</code>.

<p>The structure field words now can be used quite nicely. However,
their definition is still a bit cumbersome: We have to repeat the
name, the information about size and alignment is distributed before
and after the field definitions etc.  The structure package presented
here addresses these problems.

<h2>Usage</h2>

You can define a structure for a (data-less) linked list with
<pre>
struct
    cell% field list-next
end-struct list%
</pre>

With the address of the list node on the stack, you can compute the
address of the field that contains the address of the next node with
<code>list-next</code>. E.g., you can determine the length of a list
with:

<pre>
: list-length ( list -- n )
\ "list" is a pointer to the first element of a linked list
\ "n" is the length of the list
    0 begin ( list1 n1 )
        over
    while ( list1 n1 )
        1+ swap list-next @ swap
    repeat
    nip ;
</pre>

<p>You can reserve memory for a list node in the dictionary with
<code>list% %allot</code>, which leaves the address of the list node
on the stack. For the equivalent allocation on the heap you can use
<code>list% %alloc</code> (or, for an <code>allocate</code>-like stack
effect (i.e., with ior), use <code>list% %allocate</code>).

<p>Note that in ANS Forth the body of a <code>create</code>d word is
<code>aligned</code> but not necessarily <code>faligned</code>;
therefore, if you do a
<pre>
create <em>name</em> foo% %allot
</pre>

then the memory alloted for <code>foo%</code> is
guaranteed to start at the body of <code><em>name</em></code> only if
<code>foo%</code> contains only character, cell and double fields.

<p>You can also include a structure <code>foo%</code> as field of
another structure, with:
<pre>
struct
...
    foo% field ...
...
end-struct ...
</pre>

Instead of starting with an empty structure, you can also extend an
existing structure. E.g., a plain linked list without data, as defined
above, is hardly useful; You can extend it to a linked list of
integers, like this:

<pre>
list%
    cell% field intlist-int
end-struct intlist%
</pre>

<code>intlist%</code> is a structure with two fields:
<code>list-next</code> and <code>intlist-int</code>.

<p><!--footnote-->This feature is also known as <em>extended records</em>
<a href="#wirth88">[wirth88]</a>. It is the main innovation in the Oberon language; in other
words, adding this feature to Modula-2 led Wirth to create a new
language, write a new compiler etc.  Adding this feature to Forth just
requires a few lines of code.

<p>You can specify an array type containing </em>n</em> elements of
type <code>foo%</code> like this:

<pre>
foo% <em>n</em> *
</pre>

You can use this array type in any place where you can use a normal
type, e.g., when defining a <code>field</code>, or with
<code>%allot</code>.

<p>The first field is at the base address of a structure and the word
for this field (e.g., <code>list-next</code>) actually does not change
the address on the stack. You may be tempted to leave it away in the
interest of run-time and space efficiency. This is not necessary,
because the structure package optimizes this case and compiling such
words does not generate any code. So, in the interest of readability
and maintainability you should include the word for the field when
accessing the field.

<h2>Naming convention</h2>

The field names that come to (my) mind are often quite generic, and,
if used, would cause frequent name clashes. E.g., many structures
probably contain a <code>counter</code> field. The structure names
that come to (my) mind are often also the logical choice for the names
of words that create such a structure.

<p>Therefore, I have adopted the following naming conventions: 

<ul>

<li> The names of fields are of the form
<code><em>struct</em>-<em>field</em></code>, where
<code><em>struct</em></code> is the basic name of the structure, and
<code><em>field</em></code> is the basic name of the field. You can
think about field words as converting converts the (address of the)
structure into the (address of the) field.

<li> The names of structures are of the form
<code><em>struct</em>%</code>, where
<code><em>struct</em></code> is the basic name of the structure.

</ul>

This naming convention does not work that well for fields of extended
structures; e.g., the integer list structure has a field
<code>intlist-int</code>, but has <code>list-next</code>, not
<code>intlist-next</code>.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

The central idea in the implementation is to pass the data about the
structure being built on the stack, not in some global
variable. Everything else falls into place naturally once this design
decision is made.

<p>The type description on the stack is of the form <em>align
size</em>. Keeping the size on the top-of-stack makes dealing with arrays very simple.

<p><code>field</code> is a defining word that uses <code>create</code>
and <code>does&gt;</code>. The body of the field contains the offset
of the field, and the normal <code>does></code> action is

<pre>
@ +
</pre>

i.e., add the offset to the address, giving the stack effect
<code>addr1 -- addr2</code> for a field.

<p>This simple structure is slightly complicated by the optimization
for fields with offset 0, which requires a different
<code>does></code>-part (because we cannot rely on there being
something on the stack if such a field is invoked during
compilation). Therefore, we put the different <code>does></code>-parts
in separate words, and decide which one to invoke based on the
offset. For a zero offset, the field is basically a noop; it is
immediate, and therefore no code is generated when it is compiled.
