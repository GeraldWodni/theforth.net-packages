<h1>On Standardizing Object-Oriented Forth Extensions</h1>

<h2>Standardization and Libraries</h2>

Andrew McKewan argues that we need to agree on (i.e., standardize) one
model to start building an object-oriented library.  My view is just
the reverse: If someone writes a good object-oriented library that
everyone wants to use, we will all use the object model on which that
library is based; that model will become a de-facto standard and
finally a de-jure standard.

<p>Andrew McKewan uses the Forth scientific library (FSL) as
example. He argues that it was necessary to standardize floating-point
in ANS Forth before the FSL could be written. Even if that were true
(of which I am not convinced), the cases differ significantly: A
floating-point implementation written in Forth-83 would have been
unacceptably slow for many purposes; OTOH, many object-oriented models
can be implemented in standard Forth efficiently enough to be
useful. (BTW, this is a major strength of Forth over many other
languages: C, Pascal, Ada etc. require language changes and new
compilers to accomodate object-oriented programming; in Forth every
programmer can do it.)

<p>As a counter-example, consider the case of locals: Even though the
commitee standardized the syntax <code>LOCALS| this read can you
|</code>, many people use the syntax <code>{ you can read this
}</code>. This syntax can be implemented without performance penalty
in standard Forth (<a href="#hayes92">[hayes92]</a>, <a
href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/anslocal.fs">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/anslocal.fs</a>).

<p>What would such an object-oriented library look like? It should
have as few system dependences as possible. This excludes libraries
for dealing with windowing systems, which appear to be the most
popular application of object-oriented technology in Forth. The
library should deal with problems that are hard enough to make
reinventing the wheel unattractive.  A look at the standard libraries
of other object-oriented languages should provide some inspiration.

<h2>Consensus</h2>

The major problem with standardizing an object-oriented model by
agreeing on one is that there is no consensus. There was a discussion
of this topic on <a href="news:comp.lang.forth">comp.lang.forth</a>
(Subject: Objects for ANS Forth) in August 1996.  <a
href="#rodriguez&poehlman96">[rodriguez&poehlman96]</a> lists 17
object-oriented extensions for Forth, and this does not include
several that were discussed on <a
href="news:comp.lang.forth">comp.lang.forth</a>.

<p>OTOH, what's so bad about having no standard object model? We don't
have a standard array or structure model, either, because we can build
what we need when we need it, at little cost.

<h2>The Neon Model</h2>

I cannot create a synopsis of the complete discussion, therefore I'll
restrict myself to the points relevant to the Neon/Yerk model (as
presented in <a href="#mckewan97">[mckewan97]</a>), which is also
implemented in Mops, Win32Forth and in ANS Forth <a
href="#mckewan97">[mckewan97]</a> (as presented in <a
href="#mckewan97">[mckewan97]</a>). This model currently (in 1998)
appears to be the most popular one.  The points under discussion were:

<ul>

<li>The Neon model uses a <code><em>selector object</em></code>
syntax, which makes it unnatural to pass objects on the stack. This
syntax could make it easy to pass the selector on the stack, but that
is rarely needed (and the Neon model makes it hard to pass the
selector anyway, see below).

<p>The Neon model  uses the following
syntax for dealing with objects passed on the stack:
<pre>
<em>selector</em> [ <em>code</em> ]
</pre>

<code><em>code</em></code> must produce an object reference, which is
then consumed by the whole construction.  This syntax reduces the
extensibility (see below), and offers no advantage over the more
conventional (and therefore easier to learn) syntax

<pre>
<em>code selector</em>
</pre>

You can also use

<pre>
<em>code selector</em> [ ]
</pre>

in the Neon model.  But that's just more complex; and mixing this
syntax with the other variants makes the usage less consistent and
thus harder to read.

<li>The Neon model requires that the selector parses the input stream
(at compile-time). This leads to reduced extensibility and to bugs
that are hard to find.

<p>E.g., suppose for some reason that you want to tick a selector to
get an execution token that you can <code>EXECUTE</code> or
<code>COMPILE,</code> later. How do you pass the object to that
selector? You cannot use the natural way: to pass it on the stack;
instead, you have to manipulate the input stream.  (Charles Melice
pointed out that you can get an xt for a word that takes an object on
the stack and passes it to a selector in the following way:
<code>:noname selector: [ ] ;</code>).

<p>Once you have managed to deal with the input stream, the real
trouble starts: All selectors defined with McKewan's implementation of
the Neon model are state-smart.  I.e., what they do, depends on the
contents of <code>STATE</code> when the selector is invoked. So you
have to make sure to set <code>STATE</code> right for every place
where such a selector might be invoked. If you fail in that, the
resulting bug usually is hard to find.

<p>This should demonstrate the trouble with parsing words in general
and with the Neon model in particular.

<p>We could choose to forbid ticking (and <code>POSTPONE</code>ing)
selectors, or we could choose a model that does not have this
problem.</p>

<li>The Neon model is inefficient in the general case.

<p>The Neon model allows sending (a message with) any selector to
any object (let's call such models Smalltalk-like). This is considered
essential by some. However, it also makes it harder to create
efficient implementations.

<p>In contrast, some models (let's call them Java-like) allow sending
 only those selectors to an object that were explicitly defined for
the class of the object or its ancestor classes. Some also have
<em>multiple inheritance</em> or Java-like <em>interfaces</em>.

<p>In practice, you can program the same things with the
Smalltalk-like and Java-like models. In the Java-like models, you have
to define the selector in a common ancestor class (or common
interface) of all objects that use the selector. If you fail to do
this, and send a message to an object, for which the selector was not
defined, the result in a straightforward implementation of a Java-like
model is a crash or the invocation of an unrelated method (with a
little additional code and run-time overhead, a Java-like model can
produce a decent error message in this case, though); in contrast,
with a Smalltalk-like model you get a run-time error (<tt>message not
understood</tt>).

<p>Concerning implementation, a Java-like model can be implemented
easily and efficiently using a technique that C++ implementors call
<em>virtual function tables</em>. For a Smalltalk-like model on an
interactive system like Forth, using virtual function tables is much
harder <a href="#vitek&horspool96">[vitek&horspool96]</a>. Indeed,
AFAIK, no Smalltalk-like Forth extension uses virtual function tables;
they all use searching methods that are significantly slower.<!--
McKewan-Posting-->

<p>Proponents of Smalltalk-like models argue that most selector
lookups can be resolved at compile-time, eliminating the searching
overhead.  However, studies of programs written in full
object-oriented style (in other languages) show that message sends
occur every 60 instructions (median), and even complex analysis
algorithms leave a significant number of them unresolved (usually,
because the message send actually does invoke different methods at
run-time) <a href="#diwan+96">[diwan+96]</a>.

</ul>

We can make the Neon model standard (after all, we can still implement
the others in plain Forth), but if we do so, we should be aware of its
properties.
