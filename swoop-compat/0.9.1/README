PORTABLE SWOOP

  Get SwoopPortable.f from http://soton.mpeforth.com/flag/swoop/index.html

  Which includes a VFX Forth harness and a SwiftForth harness (although
  SwiftForth's included ASWOOP is functionality superior.)

  This package includes harnesses for gforth and iforth.

CONDITIONAL LOADING

  Portable SWOOP begins with tests that conditionally load its SwiftForth and
  VFX Harnesses.  If you'd like to add to these tests:

  [defined] gforth [if]
  include Gforthharness.fs
  [then]

  S" IFORTH" environment? [if] drop
  include iforth-harness.fs
  [then]

DEPENDENCIES

  These harnesses also depend on SwiftForth's PACKAGE words, available at
  http://theforth.net/package/package

DEFICIENCIES

  SwiftForth includes [OBJECTS ... OBJECTS] locals syntax that greatly eases
  OO-heavy code.  SwoopPortable.f lacks this syntax.

USAGE

  For example, to load and run the tests from scratch with gforth, assuming
  that PACKAGE words are in a neighboring directory, and that SwoopPortable.f has
  been placed in the current directory:

  $ gforth -e 'include ../package/compat-gforth.fs include ../package/package.fs include Gforthharness.fs include SwoopPortable.f'
